# NYC Bar Review
Novia Wu, Haitong Lin

### Introduction: 
NYC Bar Review is a site where you can get to know what people really think of the popular spots in town. We want to create a site where people can get rid of business promotions and say what they really feel. We also want to create a special evaluation system for the bars, so that our users will be able to know not only the quality of the drinks, but also the service, environment, and friendliness towards minorities.

### Use cases:
- As a user, I can create my own account
- As a user, I can write a review for a bar
- As a user, I can see all the reviews for a bar, and its upvotes and downvotes
- As a user, I can upvote or downvote a review 
- As a user, I can delete my reviews
- As a user, I can edit my reviews
- As a user, I can save a bar to my list
